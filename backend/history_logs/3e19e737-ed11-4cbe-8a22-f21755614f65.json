    "message": " 7QC, or Seven Quality Control Tools, is a set of statistical and graphical methods used in quality control to analyze, diagnose, and solve quality problems in a process. These tools were developed by Kaoru Ishikawa, a Japanese quality control expert, in the 1960s. The seven tools are:\n\n1. Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone Diagram) - a visual tool used to identify and organize potential causes for a specific effect or problem.\n2. Check Sheet - a form used to record data systematically during a study or investigation.\n3. Control Chart - a graphical tool used to study whether a process is in a state of statistical control and to help identify special causes of variation.\n4. Histogram - a bar graph used to summarize and display the distribution of quantitative data.\n5. Pareto Chart - a bar graph that ranks problems or opportunities by their frequency or importance, with the goal of identifying the most significant issues to address.\n6. Scatter Diagram - a graphical tool used to illustrate the relationship between two variables.\n7. Stratification - a technique used to group data into categories or strata to help identify patterns or trends within the data.\n\nThese tools are essential for statistical process control, root cause analysis, and process improvement initiatives. They help organizations to manage and improve the quality of their products, services,"
